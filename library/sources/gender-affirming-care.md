GD

* A systematic literature review done by Cornell University looked at 55 studies which assessed the effect of gender transition on trans well-being, it found no studies concluding that gender transition causes overall harm.[^1]
* 55 young trans adults who received puberty suppression followed by cross-sex hormones/gender-affirming surgery had alleviated GD. Psychological functioning had steadily improved and well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population.[^2]
* Gender-affirming care reduced depression by 60% and suicidality by 73% of 104 trans adolescents aged 13 - 20 in just one year.[^3]
* A 22-year follow-up of a trans man who underwent puberty suppression at 13, started androgen therapy at 17, and had surgeries at 20 and 22 showed no regrets, stable psychological/social/intellectual functioning, and no adverse impacts on brain development, bone health, or metabolic/endocrine parameters. His final height was shorter than average for Dutch males, though physical health and body proportions remained normal.[^4]
* 201 gender-diverse adolescents had improved psychosocial functioning after 6 months of psychological support. Those who received puberty suppression showed greater improvement after 12 months compared to those only receiving psychological support.[^5]
* A study of 720 adolescents who started puberty suppression before age 18 found that 98% continued GAHT at follow-up. Discontinuation rates showed no correlation with clinical factors like age at treatment initiation or puberty stage.[^6]
* Socially transitioned trans children who are supported in their gender identity have developmentally normative levels of depression and only minimal elevations in anxiety.[^7]
* Use of chosen name in trans/gender non-conforming youth resulted in a 5.37-unit decrease in depressive symptoms, 29% decrease in suicidal ideation, and a 56% decrease in suicidal behavior.[^8]
* 148 youth (ages 9 - 18) that received GAHT (25 only had puberty suppression) had a 42% decrease of suicidal ideation, 12% decrease of suicide attempts, and 34% decrease for non-suicidal self-injury.[^9]
* 50 individuals aged 16.2-18.4 years who received endocrine treatment had depression and suicidal ideation which decreased over three waves of questionnaires, while quality of life improved. Regression analysis showed that endocrine intervention was linked to these positive changes, especially in male-to-female (MTF) participants, after accounting for psychiatric medications and counseling.[^10]
* In a systematic review of three prospective studies with 247 trans adults (180 MTF and 67 FTM), two studies reported significant improvements in psychological functioning (reduced depression, anxiety) at 3-6 months and 12 months compared to baseline. The third study showed enhancements in quality of life at 12 months for both groups, but only MTF participants had a statistically significant increase.[^11]
* A study involving 913 trans individuals found that those not using cross-sex hormone treatments had a nearly four-fold increased risk of probable depressive disorder, while using CHT was associated with lower levels of depression.[^12]
* 315 trans/NB individuals (aged 12 - 20) who received GAHT had increased appearance congruence, positive affect, and life satisfaction while decreasing depression and anxiety overall, though suicidal ideation occurred in 3.5% and two participants died by suicide. Improvements in depression and life satisfaction were more pronounced in those designated female at birth, and early initiation of hormone therapy was linked to more positive outcomes. [^13] 
* 115 trans youth (aged 12 - 18) after gender-affirming medical treatment had significant reductions in body dissatisfaction, victimization, depression, and anxiety, along with improvements in parent support and psychosocial functioning. Higher initial family support, parent acceptance, and lower victimization were associated with better mental health outcomes, and reductions in body dissatisfaction correlated with fewer depression symptoms and improved psychosocial functioning.[^14] 
* Gender affirmation is linked to improved mental health. There's no evidence it drives youth suicide.[^15] 
* Long-term data suggests that gender-affirming hormone therapy has no negative effect on bone health[^16] and youth on puberty blockers overwhelmingly chose to start gender-affirming hormones.[^17] 
* Current limited evidence suggest that transgender women taking GAHT have increased risks of ischemic stroke and VTE, with the incidence rate (per year) increasing from 0.07% to 0.13% and 0.07% to 0.32%, respectively, compared to cisgender men, and these risk factors should be adequately managed.[^18]
