# Desistance / Detransition

Critics often claim gender-affirming care leads to "widespread regret" or "detransition" to question its necessity. These arguments conflate dissatisfaction with the complex, often external reasons people might detransition, while ignoring data showing overwhelmingly positive outcomes for most transgender individuals.

Regret rates for gender-affirming care and social transition are exceptionally rare. (1%) When detransition/desistance occurs, it is overwhelmingly driven by external pressures. Examples such as societal stigma, familial rejection, discrimination in healthcare or employment, or financial barriers to care; rather than dissatisfaction with treatment. For some, detransition reflects evolving self-understanding or nonbinary identity exploration, not regret. [^1]

* A systematic review of 27 studies from 14 different countries which pooled 7,928 transgender and non-binary individuals who received gender-affirming surgeries revealed an overall regret rate of 1%. This varied depending on the procedure (2% for genital reconstruction surgeries (e.g. vaginoplasty) versus less than 1% for chest masculinization surgeries. (e.g. mastectomies) The primary causes of regret involved external pressures rather than medical outcomes. Many faced social stigma, family rejection, or difficulties adapting to new gender roles in both social and family environments. In some cases, patients reported reverting to their original gender presentation to achieve social acceptance, receive better salaries, and preserve relatives and friends relationships.[^1]
* 2,863 gender-affirming surgery (GAS) procedures were performed on 1,989 patients. Six patients later requested reversal surgery or reverting to their birth-assigned gender. Five patients who underwent surgery elsewhere sought reversals (two) or pursued further transition to another gender (three). Combined, 11 patients sought reversals or additional gender-affirming procedures.[^2]
* 1,050 individuals who initiated gender-affirming hormone therapy, (GAH) 93% continued treatment, while 4% permanently discontinued. Suicidal ideation was the only factor significantly linked to discontinuation. (temporarily or permanently) Among the 37 who permanently stopped, 14 did so after achieving their gender goals, with only 5 detransitioning. Most who discontinued still identified as transgender, reflecting evolving gender identities rather than rejection of their trans identity.[^3]
* 548 Australian youth who were referred to a gender diversity service, only 5.3% (29 individuals) re-identified with their birth-registered sex, primarily before or during early assessment stages. Only two patients did so after starting puberty suppression or hormone treatment, representing 1.0% of those who began medical interventions.[^4]
* 317 transgender youth (208 MtF/109 FtM, average age 8.1 yrs at the start) after an average of 5 years, 7.3% had retransitioned at least once. At the end of the period, 94% identified as binary transgender, while 2.5% (8 youth) identified as cisgender and 3.5% (11 youth) as nonbinary. Retransitions to cisgender were more common among those who initially transitioned before age 6, often occurring before age 10.[^5]
* A survey of 220 trans youth (mean age 16.07, with 31% boys, 60% girls, and 9% gender diverse) who received gender-affirming medical care found that only 9 (4.09%) reported regret, including cases where some stopped care while others continued.[^6]
* 235 patients who underwent mastectomy, 139 responded (average age 27.1 years, with 63% identifying as male), and non-responders had longer follow-up periods and lower rates of depression and anxiety, though medication use was similar between groups. Overall, participants reported high satisfaction with their decision (median score of 5.0 out of 5) and low decisional regret (average score of 4.2 out of 100). Among the 19% who reported a change in gender identity since surgery, satisfaction remained high and regret low.[^7]
* A systematic review compared regret rates after gender-affirming surgery (GAS), which is about 1%, to those after plastic surgeries like breast reconstruction (0 - 47.1%), breast augmentation (5.1 - 9.1%), and body contouring (10.82 - 33.3%), as well as other surgeries such as prostatectomy (30%) and bariatric surgery (up to 19.5%). Major life decisions, including having children (7%) and getting tattoos (16.2%), also showed higher regret rates. Overall, regret after GAS is significantly lower than in these other areas.[^8]
